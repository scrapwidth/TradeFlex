# TradeFlex

TradeFlex is a platform designed for individual traders who want to build, test, and eventually deploy algorithmic trading strategies. This repository outlines the initial goals, design considerations, and development roadmap.

## Project Goals

- **Algorithm Interface**: Provide an easily extendable interface so algorithms can be swapped in and out without touching the core infrastructure. Each algorithm should implement standardized entry, exit, and risk management hooks.
- **Backtest Framework**: Integrate with a backtesting engine that can replay historical market data and execute algorithms to validate performance.
- **Manual Testing**: Offer a sandbox where a simple algorithm can be manually run to ensure it interacts with the backtester correctly before moving forward.
- **Unit Tests**: Build a suite of tests verifying the behavior of algorithms and the backtest harness.
- **Shadow Trading**: Design a system that mirrors real orders without executing them, showing what would have happened in a real environment.
- **Live Trading Deployment**: Provide the ability to connect to a real broker so algorithms can trade with actual capital once validated.

## Running the Project (Initial Guidance)

The codebase currently contains only documentation, but it is intended to be Python-based. A typical setup would look like:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # placeholder, to be defined
```

Backtests and algorithms would live under a `tradeflex` package. Example usage might be:

```bash
python -m tradeflex.backtest --algorithm examples/simple_algo.py --data data/historical.csv
```

## Development Roadmap

1. **Generate a Comprehensive Algorithm Interface**
   - Define a base class with methods such as `on_tick`, `on_order_filled`, and `on_exit`.
   - Allow runtime discovery of algorithms via an `algorithms` directory so new strategies can be swapped in easily.

2. **Integrate with a Backtest Framework**
   - Choose an engine (e.g., `backtrader`, `zipline`, or a minimal custom module) that can feed historical data into algorithms.
   - Ensure the interface is generic enough to plug in future data sources.

3. **Manually Test Simple Algorithm with the Backtester**
   - Create a trivial algorithm (e.g., moving average crossover).
   - Execute it against sample historical data, verifying trade signals and order handling.

4. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Use `pytest` to test algorithm logic and the backtest process.
   - Include tests for edge cases such as empty data sets and erroneous algorithm behavior.

5. **Shadow Trading Design**
   - Implement a mode that publishes trade signals but logs them instead of executing, storing results side-by-side with real account data for comparison.
   - Confirm this mode uses the same decision path as live trading so it is representative.

6. **Enable Live Trading**
   - Add broker integration (e.g., via REST or an SDK) for actual order placement.
   - Include secure storage of API keys and risk checks to limit position sizing.

7. **Iterate and Expand**
   - Document new algorithms.
   - Add performance dashboards and metrics.
   - Improve the backtest environment with additional data sources and risk analysis tools.

This project is in an early state. Follow the roadmap above to incrementally build out the full functionality.
